# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Part-Sales

A company that sells motorcycle parts needed help in analyzing their sales data.

They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.

The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. I have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included.
